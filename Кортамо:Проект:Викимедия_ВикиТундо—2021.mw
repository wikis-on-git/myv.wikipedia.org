Шумбрат!

Sorry for writing in English, please feel free to translate :)

The Ukrainian community prepared the new article lists for CEE Spring this year. You can find our new top-100 list [[:m:Wikimedia CEE Spring 2021/Structure/Ukraine]] (all suggestions are new compared to last year!) In addition, we have made two lists with gaps specifically for Erzya Wikipedia:
* [[:m:Wikimedia CEE Spring 2021/Structure/Ukraine/Red#myv Erzya]]: top 10 articles that are missing (red links) in your Wikipedia. For example, you have no article about [[Украинецт]] while 31 CEE wikis already have it.
* [[:m:Wikimedia CEE Spring 2021/Structure/Ukraine/Stubs#myv Erzya]]: top 10 articles that are stubs (only a few sentences) in your Wikipedia. For example, you have only one sentence about Ukrainian capital [[Киев ош]].

Please help us make this campaign successful, cover the red link gaps and improve the stubs about Ukraine in your wiki! — [[Теиця:NickK|NickK]] ([[Теицянь кортамось:NickK|кортнема]]) 18:31, 10 Чадыковонь 2021 (UTC)
